# flutter_audio_games

## Description

This package is intended as a Flutter replacement for
[dart_sdl](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_sdl). It provides various widgets for
rapidly building audio games, and simplifies many common tasks.

## Getting Started

To create a blank game, you can use the [flutter_audio_games_template](https://github.com/chrisnorman7/flutter_audio_games_template) template:

```shell
gh repo create --private --clone -p chrisnorman7/flutter_audio_games_template new_game
```

When you have the new repository, you will need to replace `__name__` with the actual name of your game.
